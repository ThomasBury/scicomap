Introduction
============

scicomap helps you build scientific visualizations with perceptually safer
colormaps.

Many default colormaps can create false boundaries and hide important structure.
The problem gets worse for readers with color-vision deficiency. scicomap gives
you tools to inspect these issues and correct them.

What you can do with scicomap
-----------------------------

- Browse colormaps by purpose (sequential, diverging, circular, qualitative).
- Assess lightness, chroma symmetry, and colorblind accessibility.
- Uniformize and symmetrize existing colormaps.
- Generate examples that make artifacts easy to spot.

Who this project is for
-----------------------

- Researchers and engineers preparing figures for publications.
- Data scientists building dashboards where color meaning must stay clear.
- Anyone who needs better colormap defaults in Matplotlib workflows.
