Accurate data representation is of paramount importance. Frequently used color maps often introduce data distortion
due to uneven color gradients, making them challenging to interpret, especially for individuals with color-vision deficiencies. 
One notorious example is the jet color map. Such color maps may fail to convey the complete information you intend to illustrate and, 
in some cases, even convey incorrect information due to artifacts. Whether you're a scientist or not, the aim is to present visual 
information both accurately and attractively. Additionally, it's crucial not to disregard color-vision deficiencies,
which affect approximately 8% of the Caucasian male population.
