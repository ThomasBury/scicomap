Colormap Gallery
================

Use this gallery to quickly scan colormap families before running detailed
assessment workflows.

Sequential family
-----------------

Best for ordered values with a single direction (low to high).

Multi-sequential family
-----------------------

Useful when multiple ordered bands must remain visually distinct.
